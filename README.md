# Atn shop
----------------

After analyzing the benefits that cloud computing brings to ATN company, we have decided to use cloud computing for this project, I will start implementing and creating a website project developed in Nodejs language, Express framework, and using MongoDB as the database. This project will be deployed on the internet with HEROKU. The implementation and implementation of the project will be clearly stated below.
#### Scenario:
ATN is a Vietnamese company which is selling toys to teenagers in many provinces all over Vietnam. The company has revenue of over 700,000 dollars/year. Currently, each shop has its own database to store transactions for that shop only. Each shop has to send the sale data to the board director monthly and the board director needs lots of time to summarize the data collected from all the shops. Therefore, this website system was created so that shops can use the same database. 
#### outstanding features:
- Dashboard: statistics and analysis in the form of charts and tables.

- Add, update and delete categories.
